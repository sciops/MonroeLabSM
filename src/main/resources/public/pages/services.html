                        MonroeBox is a one-way Bitcoin dispenser. 
                        Full featured Bitcoin ATMs already exist on the market, but they are expensive, require an Internet connection, and are complicated to maintain. 
                        MonroeBox is designed to be simple, with no installation required. Just plug it in and deposit Bitcoin to your private keys.

                        MonroeBox generates private keys from pre-determined seed values. 
                        This allows the operator to load Bitcoin onto the addresses without having the dispenser connected to the Internet.
                        Being an air-gapped, connectionless device means that your financial security is not complicated by another third-party.
                        You can use your own Bitcoin wallet app to maintain your funds.

                    The MonroeBox is an affordable alternative to full-feature Bitcoin ATMs.
                    A simple solution for quick setup.
                    An affordable option for any budget.
                    Consider a Bitcoin dispenser in conjunction with Bitcoin acceptors in large-scale automated vending environments such as laundromats and arcades. 
                    Replacing a token-based payment system with Bitcoin simplifies logistics and maintenance, saving you time and labor.

                        Bitcoin might be the most disruptive technology since the printing press.
                        Its potential is greatest in emerging markets with capital controls, deficit budgets, and large unbanked populations.

                        Basic banking services allow individuals to store up value, make larger purchases, start businesses, and plan for the future.
                        Advanced economies such as the United States have a relatively large number of services; with some accessibility even for lower classes.
                        In many emerging economies, options are far more limited. Infrastructure, regulation or nationalization of banking services may leave citizens with few, expensive ways to store their cash.
                        In other nations, governments with top-heavy budgets, corruption, or ineffective tax policies will over-inflate their currencies with printed cash. 
                        This devaluation adversely affects lower classes and creates uncertainty and instability.
                        A new currency like Bitcoin presents an alternative to failed monetary policy.

                    <p>
                        A cheap product such as MonroeBox that's quick to scale will drive adoption, empowering communities with a better currency.
