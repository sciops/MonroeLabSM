            MonroeBox started when I found the <a href="https://openbitcoinatm.wordpress.com/">Open Bitcoin ATM</a> sketch for Arduino. 
            This was a Bitcoin dispenser that printed pre-generated QR codes that were based on private keys.
            After building my own prototype, he decided to explore their suggestion to develop a variant that generates private keys on its own circuitry, without help from a server or storage medium.
            The result was an air-gapped, compact, and affordable device that dispenses Bitcoins for cash. This website was developed to promote the product and provide an interface to operators to calculate private keys for the device.
            Bitcoin could be disruptive in environments with capital controls and unbanked populations, and the MonroeBox is targeted to these markets.

            MonroeBox and this website are still under development, and there are currently no immediate plans for production. If you have an interest, drop me a line at <a id="emailabout"></a>
